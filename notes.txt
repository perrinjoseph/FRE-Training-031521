this can be used to create variables in css
:root{
    --size-box = 250px;
}   
.box{
width: (--size-box);
}


LEARN BOX SIZING
content-box is the total of the content size so the total will be 250 + the other stuff. 
the border-box will set the total size as 250 so content could be 210

position fixed will basically take that child element out of that parent divs and fix it on the screen
position absolute on the child means that the position will move acording to its parent element.
