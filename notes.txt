# ----------------------------------- NOTES ---------------------------------- #
✅  HTML CSS NOTES
{
    this can be used to create variables in css
    :root{
        --size-box = 250px;
    }   
    .box{
    width: (--size-box);
    }

    LEARN BOX SIZING
    content-box is the total of the content size so the total will be 250 + the other stuff. 
    the border-box will set the total size as 250 so content could be 210

    position fixed will basically take that child element out of that parent divs and fix it on the screen
    position absolute on the child means that the position will move acording to its parent element. 

    @media query 
    Css Done. 

    BEM
    block element modifier

    id has higher priority over class selector

    difference between input type= button ?
    and button tag is that the input tag is something called self closed you cannot put anything in between the input tag
    in a button tag you can put stuff in between it. 

    difference between type submit and type button?
    type submit will trigger the form on submit event. then it wont refresh the page. 
    SPA Single page application

    Use electron to build destop applications.
    * universal selector
    ::before is a pseduoselector
    css reset is done to reset default and make sure it behaves the same in all browsers and to make sure you can create your own default
    We use *::before, *::after because the universal selector does not select upseudo elements. 
    html{
         if you want to ser the root font size you can use 
         font-size: 62.25% // this is 10px which is 16px * 62.25% the reason why we are using percentage is because 
         it can be used to scale for 508 compliance if you use 10px it overrites it and does back to default.
    }
    this basically changes the now you can use rem.
    this way 1 will be 


    margin auto helps center horizontally ONLY!
    flexbox is for 1 dimentional layout. It is more popular and is supported on almost all browsers and all mobile devices
    css grind is for 2 dimentinoal layout. Now very popular and isnt supported of few browsers
    flex-wrap can be used to send things to another line

    media query you can say flex- direction to column.

    Header/nav bar
    for nav bar all you have to do is set the 
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    when you say sticky you have to give it top 0

    FOOTER
    for  footer make it fixed and set bottom:0
    then when the page shrinks to make it responsive re set the position to relative because the content will go behind the footer because it is fixed so do this.
}

✅  JavaScript Basics
{
    Web 2.0 Ajax
    //javascript = ES + browser API(because it is running by the browser is a document API which can be used by JS but not NodeJs)
    ES is the standard. 
    Node js is similar to ES  but it used NodeApi files, pathsetc which cannot be used by JS
    ducument is part of browser API so nodejs wont be able to acces it.
    primitive is just the value not the reverence to the memory location(reference).

    var is hoisted to the start of the function scope. let and const also does hoisting but the thing 
    is they it is hoisted to the block and it CANNOT be accessed before initialization.
    === DO RESEARCH
}   

✅  JavaScript Advance
{
    No overloading in JS classes only over writing so that means the last class with the same name will be invoked. 
}   

✅  JQuery some Css
{
    display none will just hide it from the display. It will also remove the space taken by that element.
    It is important to know that the tag will still be ther in the dom. 
    The fade in basically cahanges the opacity from 1 to 0 and then sets the item to display none. This means the item will no longer be there there on the screen but it will be there in the dom
    This also means that thee space ocupied will be removed. 
}

✅  React JSX
{
    import is JS module es6

    What is the Package.json?
    package.json is a JSON file that exists in the root of the Js/node project. It holds metadata relavant to the project
    and is used to manage the project's dependancies, scripts, libraries/pacakages used version number and a whole lot more. 
    It holds the dependancies that our application needs in order to work.

    npm i react react-dom? what is this?
    these are the two things that we need to use for the react libraries methods and features to use react. It also enables us to write in JSX

    package-lock.json what does that do?
    For example in our pacakge.json we have some versions. These versions refer to the current version number that is used to build the application
    if incase in the future the library or pacakge updates that can break our code. so pacakge-lock gives us that ability to lock 
    the version number so that the application will use that version of the library/package
    The goal of package-lock.json file is to keep track of the exact version of every package that is
    installed so that a product is 100% reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers.

    What is the nodemodules ??
    It actually holds all the libraries and the packages that you installed. This folder can get very large depending on how many things you use.
    package.json can be used to download all the nodemodules files.

    what is babel ?
    babel is used to transpile your newer JS syntax to older syntax that is accepted by browsers.
    bable can also convert JSX syntax this can be done with React-preset There are many babel packages to install for a react appplication these are

        1. @babel/core
            -it is the basic pacakge that is needed to be installed.
        2. @babel/preset-env
            -this is used when we need to use the latest versions of JS and we need to transpile to code into brower understood JS. 
        3. @babel/preset-react
            -take JSX code into vanila JS code. 
        4. babel-loader
            -allows us to connect to webpack. it maybe doing that by first transpiling and then bundling
